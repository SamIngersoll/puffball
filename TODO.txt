-- To implement --
- Enemy attacks
- Add behavior for when player is damaged but not killed
	- pushback or something
- Implement the global balance table, maybe as an autoload
	this will contain things like health and damage totals for enemies
	jump height, etc

-- Bugs --
- If you use the left of right arrow keys to leave a wall slide (for instance 
  on a slanted wall), you only get one jump whereas if you jump off the wall 
  you get two jumps. You should get two jumps either way.
- Sometimes when you kill enemies they dont get destroyed, not sure why that is
- when you do some combination of jumping and dashing it continues to play the 
	dash sound effect even during jumps until you hit the ground, then normal.
