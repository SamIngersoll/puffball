-- To implement --
- Enemy attacks - priority!
- Player attacks
	- maybe a sliding attack makes sense?
- Add behavior for when player is damaged but not killed
	- pushback or something
- Implement the global balance table, maybe as an autoload
	this will contain things like health and damage totals for enemies
	jump height, etc

- implement coyote time and input buffering (things to make game less frustrating)
	add controls for amount of coyote time to the global balance table.
	(especially because of the circular character collider, coyote time is extra important)
- more platforming levels to test the platforming controls
- fix self shadowing issue according to this post https://www.imaginaryrobots.net/posts/2022-02-03-understanding-light2d-masks-godot/
	- or just move the whole project to 3d and use the 3d lighting and shadow (which might be easier)

-- Animations --
- Enemy attack animation
- Wall slide animation
- Idle animation

-- Bugs --
- If you use the left of right arrow keys to leave a wall slide (for instance 
  on a slanted wall), you only get one jump whereas if you jump off the wall 
  you get two jumps. You should get two jumps either way.
- Sometimes when you kill enemies they dont get destroyed, not sure why that is
- when you do some combination of jumping and dashing it continues to play the 
	dash sound effect even during jumps until you hit the ground, then normal.
